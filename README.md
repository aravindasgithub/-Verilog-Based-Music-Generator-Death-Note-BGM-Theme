# 🎵 Verilog Music Generator – Death Note BGM

This project recreates the iconic background music from the anime *Death Note* using Verilog HDL. The music is played through a buzzer or speaker connected to an FPGA board.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Language**: Verilog
- **Development Platform**: [Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio)
- **Target Board**: iCEBreaker / iCE40 FPGA
- **Synthesis Tools**: Yosys, NextPNR, IceStorm (via Apio)

## 🚀 How It Works
The music is generated by toggling a digital output pin at specific frequencies for each note. A series of counters and delays are used to play the notes in sequence, replicating the *Death Note* BGM.

## 📁 Files
- `a.v`: Verilog source code for the music generator
- `apio.ini`: Apio configuration file
- `hardware.asc`, `hardware.bin`, `hardware.json`: Build artifacts from synthesis and place-and-route

## 🔧 Setup & Upload
1. Install Apio:  
   
   pip install apio
   apio install --all
Connect your iCEBreaker or compatible FPGA board.
